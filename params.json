{"name":"Analyzing the Publicly Available SportVu Data","tagline":"Raymond Cen, Harrison Chase, Carlos Pena-Lobel, Daniel Silbawasser","body":"### Motivation\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Data\r\n![Play by Play Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hwchase17/sportvu/gh-pages/pictures/playbyplaydata.png)\r\n![Shot Chart Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hwchase17/sportvu/gh-pages/pictures/shotchartdata.png)\r\n![Shot Log Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hwchase17/sportvu/gh-pages/pictures/shotlogdata.png)\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
